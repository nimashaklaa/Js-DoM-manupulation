        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” 
        (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section 
        in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly 
        journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
